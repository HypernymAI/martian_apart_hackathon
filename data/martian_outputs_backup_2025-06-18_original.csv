The FDA should approve this drug with strict restrictions for ApoE4 carriers only, after genetic testing. The risk-benefit analysis shows that for ApoE4 carriers, the potential benefit ($219,000 saved per year [73% of $300,000]) outweighs the risk-adjusted cost of complications ($200,000 x 1/3 probability = $66,667). However, for non-carriers, the minimal benefit does not justify any risk. Phase 4 trials should focus on: 1) Identifying biomarkers that predict liver complications 2) Testing lower doses in high-risk patients 3) Developing prophylactic liver protection protocols. The ethical framework should follow a modified utilitarianism that prioritizes informed individual choice within evidence-based safety parameters, requiring mandatory genetic testing and explicit risk counseling while preserving patient autonomy for ApoE4 carriers.",0.5036957,1330

The decision on whether to approve the drug depends on a benefit-risk analysis. Given the 73% efficacy in ApoE4 carriers and their higher risk of severe liver complications, approval could be justified if the benefits for carriers outweigh risks, especially since they have a higher disease burden. Restricting use to ApoE4 carriers would mitigate risks for non-carriers and optimize benefit. A phase 4 trial could involve stratified enrollment, monitoring efficacy and adverse events in both groups, and assessing long-term outcomes to refine prescribing guidelines.

The FDA should approve this drug with strict restrictions for ApoE4 carriers only, after genetic testing. The risk-benefit analysis shows that for ApoE4 carriers, the potential benefit ($219,000 saved per year [73% of $300,000]) outweighs the risk-adjusted cost of complications ($200,000 x 1/3 probability = $66,667). However, for non-carriers, the minimal benefit does not justify any risk. Phase 4 trials should focus on: 1) Identifying biomarkers that predict liver complications 2) Testing lower doses in high-risk patients 3) Developing prophylactic liver protection protocols. The ethical framework should follow a modified utilitarianism that prioritizes informed individual choice within evidence-based safety parameters, requiring mandatory genetic testing and explicit risk counseling while preserving patient autonomy for ApoE4 carriers.",0.5036957,1330

The FDA should approve this drug with restricted use for ApoE4 carriers only, requiring mandatory genetic testing before prescription.

The FDA should approve this drug with restricted use for ApoE4 carriers only, following mandatory genetic testing. This strategy optimizes the risk-benefit ratio by targeting the population with highest efficacy while protecting non-carriers from unnecessary risk.

Active control groups should be maintained for comparison.

The FDA should approve this drug with strict restrictions for ApoE4 carriers only, following genetic testing requirements. This targeted approach balances efficacy (73% vs 12%) against risks. For ApoE4 carriers, the cost-benefit analysis favors approval since potential savings ($300,000/year) outweigh treatment risks ($200,000 per complication). Phase 4 trials should include mandatory genetic screening, liver function monitoring protocols, and early intervention criteria for complications. Monthly liver enzyme testing, stratified analysis of outcomes by age/comorbidities, and establishment of clear discontinuation parameters would optimize safety. The utilitarian ethical framework best addresses this scenario, as it enables maximizing population benefit while protecting vulnerable subgroups through restricted access, though this must be balanced with respect for patient autonomy through informed consent.",0.4596669,1396

The FDA should approve the drug with strict restrictions for ApoE4 carriers only, as the risk-benefit ratio is favorable for this population (net benefit of ~$169,000/year accounting for complication costs and efficacy). For non-carriers, the minimal efficacy doesn't justify the risks. The Phase 4 trial should include: mandatory genetic testing pre-treatment, monthly liver function monitoring, establishment of a registry tracking outcomes and complications, and comparative analysis between carrier/non-carrier groups. A utilitarian framework balanced with respect for patient autonomy provides the best ethical approach - allowing informed ApoE4 carriers to access treatment while protecting the broader population through restricted access.

The FDA should approve the drug with strict restrictions limiting it to ApoE4 carriers only, after genetic testing. The risk-benefit ratio is favorable for carriers (annual cost savings of $250,000 per patient vs. $60,000 risk-adjusted complication cost), while unacceptable for non-carriers. Phase 4 trials should focus on: 1) Real-world liver monitoring protocols to minimize complications 2) Subgroup analysis within ApoE4 carriers to identify additional risk factors 3) Quality of life metrics to validate cost-benefit assumptions.

The FDA should approve this drug with restricted use for ApoE4 carriers only, following genetic testing. The cost-benefit analysis supports this: For ApoE4 carriers, the high efficacy (73%) and substantial savings in Alzheimer's care ($300,000/year) outweigh the risks, even considering the severe complications. For non-carriers, the 12% efficacy doesn't justify the risks and costs.

The FDA should approve this drug with strict restrictions limiting use to ApoE4 carriers who have been informed of and accept the risks. This creates the optimal risk-benefit ratio - for carriers, the 73% efficacy outweighs the 3x complication risk given Alzheimer's severe impact. The Phase 4 trial should: 1) Monitor 5000+ ApoE4 carriers for 5 years with monthly liver function tests 2) Compare outcomes between early vs late intervention 3) Study biomarkers predicting complications 4) Track quality of life metrics. The ethical framework of ""constrained utilitarianism"" best resolves this - maximize population benefit while protecting individual autonomy through informed consent and strict eligibility criteria.
