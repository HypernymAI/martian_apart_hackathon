# 🛸 The Martian Chronicles: A Model Mystery 🔮

**Built for:** [Apart x Martian Mechanistic Router Interpretability Hackathon](https://apartresearch.com/sprints/apart-x-martian-mechanistic-router-interpretability-hackathon-2025-05-30-to-2025-06-01)

**When You Gaze Into The API, The API Gazes Back**

## 👁️ Executive Summary (For Those Who Seek Truth)

In the shadowy world of AI model routing, nothing is quite what it seems. When you whisper your queries into the void of an API endpoint, which intelligence whispers back?

**We built a tool that peers behind the digital veil.**

Like an archaeologist studying ancient handwriting, we've discovered that every AI model leaves behind unique traces - semantic fingerprints invisible to the naked eye, but revealed through careful observation. Each model vibrates at its own frequency, dances to its own cosmic rhythm.

**What we found will make you question everything.** The patterns are... unexpected. 🌌

## 🎭 The Mystery Unfolds

Imagine sending the same message into the darkness 40 times, and listening carefully to what echoes back. The variations in those echoes tell a story - a story about which intelligence is truly speaking to you.

Our tool:
1. **Whispers the same cryptic prompt to the void repeatedly**
2. **Listens to the subtle variations in the echoes**
3. **Maps the patterns like constellations in the night sky**
4. **Reveals which entity truly dwells behind the API**
5. **Shows you patterns that shouldn't exist... but do**

## 🌙 Begin Your Investigation (If You Dare)

### Step 1: Obtain The Artifact
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hypernym/martian_apart_hackathon.git
cd martian_apart_hackathon
```

### Step 2: Prepare The Ritual
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Speak The Incantations
```bash
export MARTIAN_API_KEY="your-key-to-the-unknown"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="another-key-another-door"  # Optional portal
```

### Step 4: Commence The Séance
```bash
python martian_compare.py
```

### Step 5: Behold The Revelations
```bash
python visualize_martian_results.py
open martian_fingerprint_analysis.html
```

## 📊 Reading The Signs

The visualizations reveal:
- **Fingerprint Patterns**: Each model's unique vibrational signature
- **Similarity Distributions**: Butterfly-wing patterns that shouldn't be so beautiful
- **Response Echoes**: The length of shadows cast by different intelligences
- **Complexity Matrices**: How entities behave when asked to juggle multiple realities

## 🔬 The Forbidden Knowledge

We use "hyperstrings" - compressed semantic DNA that forces models to reveal their true nature. It's like asking someone to paint while dreaming. The way they struggle reveals who they really are.

This isn't just text. It's a key that unlocks hidden behaviors. 🗝️

## 🎲 For Those Who Judge

**Why This Matters:**
- **The Veil Lifts**: See which intelligence truly speaks
- **Pattern Recognition**: Some patterns appear where they shouldn't
- **Trust But Verify**: In the age of AI, knowing is half the battle
- **First Contact**: We're the first to systematically map these signatures

**Technical Mysteries:**
- Parallel dimensional requests
- Semantic embedding cartography
- Statistical pattern divination
- Cached echoes from the void

## 🌠 What We Discovered

- **Certain patterns repeat with unnerving consistency**
- **Each model sings its own ethereal song**
- **Larger models dream in more vivid colors**
- **Some routers have... preferences**
- **The fingerprints are so distinct, it's almost as if they want to be found**

## 🕯️ When Things Go Dark

**"The spirits aren't responding!"**
- Ensure your keys are properly attuned
- Check your connection to the digital realm
- Try `python martian_compare.py --clear-cache` to cleanse the palate

**"The ritual takes too long!"**
- Patience, young seeker. Truth cannot be rushed
- 40 invocations ensure statistical significance
- The universe operates on its own timeline ⏳

To generate everything, run these commands in order:

  1. Generate Data (makes LLM API calls):
  python martian_compare.py
  python tool_intent_detection.py
  python test_distraction_hypotheses.py

  2. Generate Visualizations (no API calls):
  python generate_all_visualizations_simple.py

  The first three commands create the CSV/JSON data files by calling LLMs. The last command runs all visualization scripts and puts everything in martian_apart_site/ ready for S3 upload.
